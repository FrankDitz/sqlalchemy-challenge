# sqlalchemy-challenge
This challenge had us analyse and explore the climate data for data given. We had to create and engine and query data that would provide us with the data we needed for this assignment before using skills previously acquired through class and other homeworks to analyse the data. The data analysis included making graphs of the data as well. The hardest part of the assignment was crating the queries for data retrieval. Once this was achieved, things ran relatively smoothly with the only other trouble coming from the creation of the histogram (particularry creating and using bins). Assistance was provided to me through the online tutor program as well as a couple students from the class. A youtube tutorial on creating histograms was used as well.
